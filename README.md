# Hand-Gesture-Control
Controlling a SBC (Raspberry Pi 4 &amp; Oak D Lite) using various hand Gestures 

Using a python virutal environment, a python System control file and a Luxonis Tensor Processing Unit I was able to control my rasberryPi using my hand. 

I will not go through the whole setup process for the Pi4 (for now) but my paper and attached images will show what the end process looked like. You can also run this on a google collab document that I have attached with the weights and config file I have.
